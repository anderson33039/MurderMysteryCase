            <b>Physical appearance(s):</b> <br>
            Lorenzo is a charismatic individual with a distinctive appearance. His short, dark brown hair is often styled in a messy, effortless look, framing his bright, piercing blue eyes that sparkle with curiosity. A strong jawline and a small scar above his left eyebrow, a souvenir from a childhood accident, add a touch of ruggedness to his features. Lorenzo's smile is his most disarming asset, charming and slightly crooked, making him instantly endearing and approachable. He often wears a silver necklace with a small, intricately designed pendant, and his signature accessory is a red cloth, which he wears as a bandana or tied around his wrist, adding a pop of color to his outfit.

He looks so nervous that time and left immediately." <br><br>"A man followed her wearing a red scarf and I heard he called him '<a href="john.html?foundclue=true">John</a>' before the suspect stab him.

          You: "You seems suspicious, you keep pointing at others."<br><br>
          
          Lorenzo: "Am just helping you Detective. It's up to you if you will listen or not."</p>

            Lorenzo: "Oh, you found my calling card in the victim's pocket."<br><br>

            Lorenzo: "Well, I indeed gave it to him... but what's the point? I mean it is just a calling card though."

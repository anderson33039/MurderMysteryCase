    <h2>Summary of event</h2>
    <p>Yohan and Bryan had an argument yesterday. Bryan called his old friend Vince to join him drink at the bar. While he's waiting, he met John, they've talked a while and Bryan decided to come home since Vince didn't showed up. He went to a convenience store to buy some milk and coffee and there he met Lorenzo. Lorenzo gave Bryan his calling card. After that, Bryan took a shortcut but the killer showed up and stabbed his neck and fled away.</p>
